An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders) to make the element "stand out".<br>

However, the outline property is different from the border property.<br>

The outline is not a part of an element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> IE8 supports the outline properties only if a !DOCTYPE is specified.</p>
