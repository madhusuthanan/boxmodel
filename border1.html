All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

The box model allows us to place a border around elements and space elements in relation to other elements.

Explanation of the different parts:<br>

    Margin - Clears an area around the border. The margin does not have a background color, it is completely transparent<br>
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content. The border is inherited from the color property of the box<br>
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is affected by the background color of the box<br>
    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
